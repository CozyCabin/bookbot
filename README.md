# bookbot
Created as a project for the Boot.dev course. Python script to show word and character counts from a document

## Usage

Currently it is only able to scan a document by entering the file location manually within the script.

## Note

This is a project built as a way for me to learn and practice programming. I may or may not return to this project in the future once I have further built my skills.
